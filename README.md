2. Create billing alerts
3. Set up account alias
4. Configure Free Tier alerts
5. Document and reflect

## Exercise 1: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds a second layer of security beyond your password. Even if your password is compromised, attackers cannot access your account without the MFA code.

### Steps:

**1. Sign in as Root User**
- Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
- Use your account email and password

**2. Navigate to Security Credentials**
- Click your account name (top right corner)
- Select "Security credentials"

**3. Enable MFA**
- Scroll to "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section
- Click "Activate MFA"

**4. Choose Virtual MFA Device**
- Select "Virtual MFA device"
- Click "Continue"

**5. Set Up Authenticator App**
- Open your authenticator app on your phone
- Scan the QR code shown by AWS
- Or manually enter the secret key

**6. Enter Two Consecutive MFA Codes**
- Enter the first 6-digit code from your app
- Wait for the code to refresh (~30 seconds)
- Enter the second 6-digit code
- Click "Assign MFA"

**7. Verify Success**
- You should see "MFA device successfully associated"
- Note: Save backup codes if offered!

### Deliverable:
- Screenshot showing MFA successfully enabled
- Save to `screenshots/mfa-enabled.png`

**2. Enable Alerts**
- Check ☑️ "Receive PDF Invoice By Email"
- Check ☑️ "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts"
- Check ☑️ "Receive Billing Alerts"
- Enter your email address
- Click "Save preferences"

**Note:** It may take 15-30 minutes for billing alerts to activate.

### Part B: Create CloudWatch Billing Alarm

**1. Navigate to CloudWatch**
- Search for "CloudWatch" in AWS Console search bar
- Click "CloudWatch"

**2. Create Billing Alarm**
- In left sidebar: Alarms → Billing
- Click "Create alarm"

**3. Select Metric**
- Click "Select metric"
- Choose "Billing" → "Total Estimated Charge"
- Check the box for "USD"
- Click "Select metric"

**4. Define Alarm Conditions**
- Threshold type: **Static**
- Whenever EstimatedCharges is: **Greater than**
- Define threshold value: **10** (for $10)
- Click "Next"

**5. Configure Notifications**
- Click "Create new topic"
- Topic name: `billing-alerts`
- Email endpoint: Your email address
- Click "Create topic"
- Click "Next"

**6. Name Your Alarm**
- Alarm name: `Billing-Alert-$10`
- Alarm description: `Alert when charges exceed $10`
- Click "Next"

**7. Review and Create**
- Review all settings
- Click "Create alarm"

**8. Confirm Email Subscription**
- Check your email for "AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation"
- Click "Confirm subscription"

### Deliverables:
- Screenshot of billing preferences saved: `screenshots/billing-preferences.png`
- Screenshot of alarm created: `screenshots/billing-alarm.png`
- Screenshot of email confirmation: `screenshots/sns-confirmed.png`

## Exercise 3: Create Account Alias

An account alias makes your sign-in URL easier to remember.

### Steps:

**1. Navigate to IAM**
- Search for "IAM" in console search bar
- Click "IAM"

**2. Create Account Alias**
- In the IAM Dashboard, find "AWS Account" section
- Click "Create" next to "Account Alias"
- Enter a unique alias (e.g., `yourname-ironhack-bootcamp`)
- Click "Create alias"

**3. Note Your New Sign-In URL**
- Your URL is now: `https://YOUR-ALIAS.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`
- Test it by signing out and back in

### Deliverable:
- Screenshot of account alias created: `screenshots/account-alias.png`
- Document your alias in `SOLUTION.md`

## Exercise 4: Configure Free Tier Alerts

Monitor your Free Tier usage to avoid unexpected charges.

### Steps:

**1. Navigate to Billing Dashboard**
- Account name → Billing Dashboard

**2. Access Free Tier**
- In left sidebar, click "Free Tier"

**3. Review Current Usage**
- Examine each service's usage
- Note which services you're using
- Check for any warnings (yellow/orange)

**4. Set Up Email Alerts** (if not done in Exercise 2)
- Billing preferences → "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts"

### Deliverable:
- Screenshot of Free Tier dashboard: `screenshots/free-tier-dashboard.png`
- Document your current usage in `SOLUTION.md`

Answer the following questions in `SOLUTION.md`:

1. **Why is MFA important even for a personal learning account?**

2. **What would happen if you left your root user unprotected?**

3. **How do billing alerts help prevent unexpected charges?**

4. **What threshold did you set for your billing alert and why?**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access Billing Dashboard

**Cause:** Not signed in as root user

**Solution:** Sign out and sign back in using your account email (root user)

---

### Issue: MFA showing "Invalid code"

**Cause:** Time sync issue between device and AWS

**Solution:**
- Check device time settings (should be automatic)
- Ensure authenticator app is synced
- Try re-scanning QR code
- Use a different authenticator app

---

### Issue: Not receiving billing alert emails

**Cause:** SNS subscription not confirmed

**Solution:**
- Check email (including spam folder)
- Look for "AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation"
- Click confirmation link
- Wait a few minutes for activation

---

### Issue: Can't create CloudWatch billing alarm

**Cause:** Billing alerts not enabled

**Solution:**
- Go to Billing Dashboard → Billing preferences
- Check "Receive Billing Alerts"
- Save preferences
- Wait 15-30 minutes
- Try creating alarm again
